    <p>Hello my name is Jack Stone and I have always enjoyed video games.I have a Youtube channel of <a
            href="guides.html">GamingStone</a> as well. My first video game console that I owned was the Nintendo
        entertainment system or NES for short. I still have it even! I have mostly been a Playstation fan but my fiance
        won a Xbox Series X from Taco Bell. I have really been enjoying it as well.</p>

    <p>These are the consoles that I have owned over the years. Most of the them I still own. I would like to know if
        you have owned any of these same consoles as well?</p>
